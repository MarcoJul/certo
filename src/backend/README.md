## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 18.0.0

### Installation

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```
   cd src/backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run develop
   ```

4. Access the admin panel at: http://localhost:1337/admin

### Environment Variables

The application uses various environment variables for configuration. 
In a production environment, make sure to set:

- `HOST` - Host name (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `PORT` - Port to run on (default: 1337)
- `APP_KEYS` - Secret keys for the app

For production, it's recommended to use PostgreSQL or MySQL instead of SQLite.

## Development

### Custom API Creation

To create a new API:

```bash
npx strapi generate
```

Select "api" from the menu and follow the interactive prompts.

### Adding a Custom Controller Method

Create a custom controller method by extending the core controller:

```typescript
export default factories.createCoreController('api::yourmodel.yourmodel', ({ strapi }) => ({
  async customMethod(ctx) {
    // Your custom logic
  },
}))
```

### Adding a Custom Route

Create a new file in `src/api/[api-name]/routes/` with your route definition:

```typescript
export default {
  routes: [
    {
      method: 'GET',
      path: '/yourpath',
      handler: 'controller.method',
      config: {
        auth: false,
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

## Deployment
